# Clinica Lavie HandsOn 3

To assist with services, they need an API that allows creating records for psychologists, patients, and medical records. During a conversation with the Front-end team and the Product Owners (PO), several groups of endpoints were decided upon.

## 📋 Prerequisites

This project was developed in Node.js, so it requires installation (to install Node.js, [click here](https://nodejs.org/en/)).

## 📝 Features

#### Database

Creation of the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) and the SQL script to generate the database. The endpoints must be analyzed to structure the database according to the requirements, considering the data that make up the three entities of the system:
- Patients
- Psychologists
- Services

The database script is located in `src/database/database.sql`.

#### BackEnd

- Login
- CRUD Psychologists
- CRUD Patients
- CRUD Services
- Dashboard
